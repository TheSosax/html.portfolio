 <h1>The Best Movies According to Samuel Calvo Rodríguez</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <h3>Hacksaw Ridge (2016)</h3>
 <p>Based on a true story, "Hacksaw Ridge" follows the life of Desmond Doss,
 a devout Christian and conscientious objector who served as a combat medic during World War II.
 Refusing to carry or use a weapon due to his religious beliefs, Doss nevertheless displayed
 extraordinary bravery during the Battle of Okinawa, saving the lives of over 70 fellow soldiers.
 This film is one of my all-time favorites because it powerfully portrays an unshakable faith in God.
 Desmond Doss went to war without a weapon, fully willing to risk his life in order to save others.
 He believed that if people were contributing to the destruction of the world, he would take part 
 in rebuilding it—one person at a time. The blend of faith, love, and brutal violence creates a masterpiece.
 At one moment, you're in a peaceful town surrounded by loved ones, and the next you're witnessing
 the horrors of war, surrounded by mutilated bodies on the battlefield. Yet through it all, Desmond's
 unwavering faith and courage serve as a profound source of inspiration.</p>

 <h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
 <p>Directed by Christopher Nolan, "The Dark Knight" is the second installment of the acclaimed Batman trilogy.
 It follows Bruce Wayne as Batman, facing off against the Joker, a criminal mastermind whose chaotic actions
 threaten to destroy Gotham City. The film explores deep philosophical and moral themes, as Batman struggles
 with his own sense of justice.
 This is my favorite superhero movie, and I included it in this list to diversify the genres. It stands out as a
 cinematic masterpiece, featuring phenomenal performances by Christian Bale as Batman and Heath Ledger as the Joker.
 The constant moral dilemmas faced by Batman, combined with the chaotic and brilliant mind of the Joker, result in
 one of the most impactful films not only in the superhero genre but in cinema as a whole.</p>

 <h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
 <p>Regarded as one of the greatest films in cinematic history, "The Godfather" tells the story of the Corleone family,
 an Italian-American mafia dynasty. The film focuses on the aging patriarch Vito Corleone and the transformation of
 his youngest son, Michael, from reluctant outsider to ruthless mafia boss.
 I found this film absolutely captivating. The story is brilliantly crafted, and the characters are incredibly complex
 and brought to life by outstanding performances. Marlon Brando delivers an unforgettable portrayal of Vito Corleone,
 while Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone—remarkably, in just his third film. What makes the movie so compelling to me
 is the contrast between father and son: Vito always prioritized family, which brought him both success and respected
 relationships, despite his criminal background. Michael, however, inherited his father's empire but chose a different
 path—putting business above family. This shift led to greater wealth but also to the destruction of the very
 relationships his father had built. It's a powerful, violent story with a strong message: family must always
 come before business, no matter the cost.</p>
